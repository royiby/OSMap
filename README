there's a guide to this code on 
http://www.linnovate.net/blog/android-mapping-hebrew-or-using-osmdroid-api-ease

changelog:
I added an overlay that deals with non gps locations - ie stations:

1. added the overlay class newItemizedOverlay.
2. added this code to the map activity:
      //grab your application's resources to use your drawables (in this case).
        res = this.getResources();
      //create an ArrayList of stations.
        stations = new ArrayList<OpenStreetMapViewOverlayItem>();
      //create station(s) (sorry for the 80's refference :)
        stations.add(new OpenStreetMapViewOverlayItem("Here i am!", "rocking like a hurricane!!!", new GeoPoint(32.000000,35.000000)));
      //create the overlay with the stations you created earlier and a marker base for the stations (i chose the android icon - very original, i know :)
        mStationOverlay = new newItemizedOverlay<OpenStreetMapViewOverlayItem>
        (
        		this, 
        		stations, 
        		this.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.androidmarker), 
        		null, 
        		this.getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.androidmarker), 
        		null, 
        		0, 
        		null, 
        		mResourceProxy
        );
       //add the stations overlay to the map
        mOSMap.getOverlays().add(mStationOverlay); 
I know that there's a problem with the afformentioned link, it will be resolved soon.

good luck
